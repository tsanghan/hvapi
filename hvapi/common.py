  """
  Implements 'open class' pattern for python. Allow to add members for already existing class.
  This example shows how to make Test class with tho methods in tho class definitions::

     class Test(object):
       def method1(self):
         pass


      @opencls(Test)
      class Test(object)
       def method2(self):
         pass

  So, this will results in one Test class that will have methods from both definitions.

  :return: modified class object
